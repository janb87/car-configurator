# Car Configurator

Car configurator app, developed just for fun.

## Should have

1. Being able to customize a car
    1. Brand (using data from this [api](https://car-api.firebaseio.com/rest.json))
    2. Color
    3. Rims
    4. Paint jobs (eg flames on the sides)
    5. Exhaust size
2. Don't use any images (including SVG or Canvas), try to do as much as possible using CSS
3. Use next generation Javascript / CSS
4. Minification / any other optimizations for Production
5. Proper HTML semantics
6. Responsive design

## Nice to have

1. Auto-saving configuration to the `localStorage`
2. Sharing configuration using a url
3. Server side rendering
